        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqU8dPalR9E/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="sasuke" style="width:800px;height:450px;">
        <h2>Required Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup bonito flakes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 fresh tomato or 1 of Sasuke's Soy-Pickled Tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 sheets nori</li>
            <li>4 cups freshly cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Now lets make it!:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin to prepare the filling by mixing the bonito flakes with the soy sauce.</li>
            <li>Quarter the tomato, remove as much of the pulp as you can, then chop into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Toast the nori sheets briefly, holding them a few inches over an open flame such as a lighter or a gas stove burner on low, until the color darkens. Then cut into eight squares.</li>
            <li>To shape the onigiri, place a small bowl of salted water to the side to use for rinsing your hands. Keeping your hands wet, flatten out 1/2 cup of rice in your hands and make an indentation in the middle, placing a small amount of either the okaka or tomatoes in the center.</li>
            <li>Gently round the rice over the top of the filling, then press together firmly with your hands. Shape it into a ball, or, if you're feeling extra fancy, a flattened triangle.</li>
            <li>To finish, sprinkle some sesame seeds on top of each onigiri, then place it in a nori square and press the nori firmly into the rice to adhere it to the surface. Set aside and continue with the remaining rice, rewetting your hands as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve at room temperature for best texture.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
